# A Standardized Framework for Sensor Placement in Human Motion Capture

A unified framework for standardizing sensor placement across different sensing modalities and applications in human motion capture and wearable technology.

## Overview

This framework addresses the critical need for standardized sensor placement protocols in human movement analysis and physiological monitoring. While existing standards like SENIAM address specific applications, there has been no comprehensive framework spanning different sensing modalities and applications. Our standard ensures reproducibility and transferability of human movement data across different recording systems and research domains.

## Key Features

- **Precise Anatomical Landmarks**: Comprehensive set of anatomical landmarks chosen for reliability and accessibility
- **Standardized Coordinate Systems**: Clear definitions for 16 major body segments
- **Hierarchical Reference Frames**: Structured approach to relating different coordinate systems
- **Quantified Precision Levels**: Three-tier system for placement accuracy
- **BIDS/HED Compatible**: Designed to work with existing data sharing standards

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the research community in several key areas:

- Standard vocabulary and communication formats through BIDS, HED, and other specifications
- Validation studies for inter-operator reliability assessment
- Mappings between this framework and existing standards (such as SENIAM)
- Software tools for coordinate calculation and placement visualization

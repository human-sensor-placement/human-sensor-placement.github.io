    "section": "",
    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThis website presents a unified framework for sensor placement in human motion capture and wearable applications. For the complete research paper, please visit our preprint on bioRxiv (link to be updated).\n\n\n\n\nThe proliferation of wearable sensors and monitoring technologies has created an urgent need for standardized sensor placement protocols. While existing standards like SENIAM address specific applications, there is no comprehensive framework that spans different sensing modalities and applications. We present a unified sensor placement standard that ensures reproducibility and transferability of human movement data across different recording systems and research domains.\n\n\n\n\n\nA reference frame consists of an origin point and a set of axes that define directions in space. In human movement analysis, we encounter multiple reference frames:\n\nGlobal laboratory frame: The fixed reference frame of the measurement space\nAnatomical frames: Tied to specific body segments\nSensor-specific frames: Related to individual sensor positioning\n\nA coordinate system is fully described by: 1. The origin relative to which coordinates are expressed 2. The interpretation of the three axes 3. The units in which measurements are expressed\n\n\n\nReference frames can have a hierarchical structure, where one frame is nested within another. For example: - Torso position within the room frame - Arm position relative to the torso - Hand position relative to the arm\nThe global reference frame sits at the top of this hierarchy, associated with the space through which the entire body moves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe define precise anatomical coordinate systems for each body segment using palpable landmarks. These definitions ensure consistent interpretation and implementation across different applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe complete anatomical landmark table with detailed coordinate systems for all body segments is available here.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur unified placement scheme follows these core principles:\n\nSensor placement must be reproducible by a human with defined precision\nPlacement coordinates relate to anatomical landmarks of the relevant body part\nLandmarks define the origin, direction, and limits of axes\nSensor locations are reported as ratios of the axis limits\nPlacement precision depends on landmarks, axes, and measurement method\n\n\n\n\nWe define three levels of placement precision:\n\nLevel 1: ~10% precision, such as Visual Inspection\n\nPlacement defined by visual inspection of body parts and landmarks\nLimited by human eye resolution and alignment ability\n\nLevel 2: ~5% precision, such as Tape Measure\n\nPlacement defined by measuring distances between landmarks\nLimited by tape measure resolution and alignment ability\n\nLevel 3: ~1% precision, such as 3D Scanning\n\nPlacement defined by 3D scanning body parts\nLimited by scanner resolution and alignment ability\n\n\n\n\n\nSensor placement should be documented using a standardized format that includes:\n\nBody part name\nAxis name and direction\nAxis limits\nSensor location (as ratio of axis limits)\nPlacement precision level\n\nThis framework does not prescribe specific annotation formats; different standards and specification can use the principles to develop their own. However, this framework is designed to be compatible with existing data sharing standards such as Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) and Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED). Specifically, using this framework would provide precise details for the sensor placement as described in Motion-BIDS.\nAn exemplar annotation following the general HED instructions can be represented as:\n(Body-part, (X-position/#, Y-position/#, Z-position/#), Precision)\n(note that the exact HED tags are under development under HED-SLAM)\nThis standardization framework represents a significant step toward improving data quality, reproducibility, and interoperability in human movement analysis, from clinical biomechanics to continuous health monitoring."

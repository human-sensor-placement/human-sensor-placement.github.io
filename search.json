    "text": "Optical Motion Capture (OMC)\nOptical Motion Capture (OMC) systems utilize multiple cameras to track the movement of reflective markers placed on a subject’s body or objects. These markers reflect light emitted by the cameras, allowing the system to triangulate their positions in three-dimensional space. The cameras record the positions of these markers at high frame rates, capturing data on marker positions (POS) and, optionally, orientation (ORNT). Additionally, velocity (VEL), acceleration (ACCEL), and angular acceleration (ANGACCEL) data can be derived from the marker positions over time. Marker placement should define the type, size, and shape of markers, along with their specific placement on anatomical landmarks, such as joints and limb segments."

IMUs measure changes in acceleration (ACCEL), angular acceleration (ANGACCEL), velocity (VEL), and orientation (ORNT). They are compact and versatile, making them suitable for wearable applications like sports performance analysis and motion tracking in remote or outdoor environments. Positioning of the IMU on the body should include details about the location and orientation, typically described using text and photographs or diagrams showing the sensor’s orientation relative to the body part it is attached to."

Markerless motion capture is non-invasive and captures natural movement, making it popular in entertainment, biomechanics, and human-computer interaction.

The reference frame at the top of this hierarchy is the global reference frame, associated with the space through which the entire body moves. This representation is useful in scenarios where the location of the person in space is relevant rather than their posture or limb motion."
